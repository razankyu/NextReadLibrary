He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. People call him &ldquo;the bitter neighbor from hell.&rdquo; But must Ove be bitter just because he doesn&rsquo;t walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time? Behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness. So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove&rsquo;s mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul. All of which will change one cranky old man and a local residents&rsquo; association to their very foundations. A feel-good story in the spirit of The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry and Major Pettigrew&rsquo;s Last Stand, Fredrik Backman&rsquo;s novel about the angry old man next door is a thoughtful exploration of the profound impact one life has on countless others. &ldquo;If there was an award for &lsquo;Most Charming Book of the Year,&rsquo; this first novel by a Swedish blogger-turned-overnight-sensation would win hands down&rdquo; (Booklist, starred review).", "publisher": "Atria Books", "publish_date": "2015-06-02", "length": "352.0", "isbn13": "9781476738024", "isbn10": "1476738025", "added": "2026-01-01"}, {"title": "A Map of Days", "author": "Ransom Riggs", "status": "Not started", "rating": "", "tags": [], "description": "", "publisher": "Dutton", "publish_date": "2018-10-01", "length": "", "isbn13": "9780735231566", "isbn10": "0735231567", "added": "2026-01-01"}, {"title": "A Monster Calls", "author": "Patrick Ness, Siobhan Dowd", "status": "Not started", "rating": "", "tags": [], "description": "The monster showed up just after midnight.

This story is, in short, about a monster meeting another monster.  One of the monsters is me. Yunjae was born with a brain condition called Alexithymia that makes it hard for him to feel emotions like fear or anger. He does not have friends--the two almond-shaped neurons located deep in his brain have seen to that--but his devoted mother and grandmother provide him with a safe and content life. Their little home above his mother's used bookstore is decorated with colorful Post-it notes that remind him when to smile, when to say \"thank you,\" and when to laugh. Then on Christmas Eve--Yunjae's sixteenth birthday--everything changes. A shocking act of random violence shatters his world, leaving him alone and on his own. Struggling to cope with his loss, Yunjae retreats into silent isolation, until troubled teenager Gon arrives at his school, and they develop a surprising bond. As Yunjae begins to open his life to new people--including a girl at school--something slowly changes inside him. And when Gon suddenly finds his life at risk, Yunjae will have the chance to step outside of every comfort zone he has created to perhaps become the hero he never thought he would be.

And she is not passive-aggressive. Not in the least. It's just that sometimes people interpret her helpful suggestions as criticisms, which is certainly not her intention. She is not one to judge others no matter how ill-mannered, unkempt, or morally suspect they might be.

When Britt-Marie walks out on her cheating husband and has to fend for herself in the miserable backwater town of Borg of which the kindest thing one can say is that it has a road going through it she is more than a little unprepared.

She finds herself being drawn into the daily doings of her fellow citizens, an odd assortment of miscreants, drunkards, layabouts and a handsome local policeman whose romantic attentions to Britt-Marie are as unmistakable as they are unwanted.

In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back.  Ego Is the Enemy draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to his­tory. We meet fascinating figures such as George Marshall, Jackie Robinson, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, who all reached the highest levels of power and success by con­quering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well.  In an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion, the battle against ego must be fought on many fronts.

Soon, he'll turn eighteen and then he'll be able to unplug all these machines and actually go see the world, not just its hospitals. Will's exactly what Stella needs to stay away from. If he so much as breathes on Stella she could lose her spot on the transplant list. Either one of them could die. The only way to stay alive is to stay apart. But suddenly six feet doesn't feel like safety. It feels like punishment. What if they could steal back just a little bit of the space their broken lungs have stolen from them? Would five feet apart really be so dangerous if it stops their hearts from breaking too?", "publisher": "Simon &amp; Schuster Children's", "publish_date": "2019-01-10", "length": "288.0", "isbn13": "9781471182310", "isbn10": "1471182312", "added": "2026-01-01"}, {"title": "For Whom the Bell Tolls (Vintage War)", "author": "Ernest Hemingway", "status": "Not started", "rating": "", "tags": [], "description": "", "publisher": "Vintage", "publish_date": "2014-01-01", "length": "", "isbn13": "9780099595533", "isbn10": "0099595532", "added": "2026-01-01"}, {"title": "Girl, Interrupted", "author": "Susanna Kaysen", "status": "Not started", "rating": "", "tags": [], "description": "In 1967, after a session with a psychiatrist she&#039;d never seen before, eighteen-year-old Susanna Kaysen was put in a taxi and sent to McLean Hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;She spent most of the next two years on the ward for teenage girls in a psychiatric hospital as renowned for its famous clientele--Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell, James Taylor, and Ray Charles--as for its progressive methods of treating those who could afford its sanctuary.

It examines how people, organisations, and societies can and must transform, how they must 'hit refresh' in their persistent quest for new energy, new ideas, and continued relevance and renewal. Yet at its core, it's about humans and how one of our essential qualities - empathy - will become ever more valuable in a world where technological advancement will alter the status quo as never before. In addition to his thoughts on these stunning scientific leaps, Satya Nadella discusses his fascinating childhood before immigrating to the U.S. and how he learned to lead along the way. He then shares his meditations as sitting CEO - one who is mostly unknown following the brainy Bill Gates and energetic Steve Ballmer. He explains how the company rediscovered its soul - transforming everything from its culture to its business partnerships to the fiercely competitive landscape of the industry itself. Nadella concludes by introducing an equation to restore digital trust, ethical design principles, and economic growth for everyone. 'Ideas excite me,' Nadella explains.

For decades, we've been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. \"F**k positivity,\" Mark Manson says. \"Let's be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.\" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Mason doesn't sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is--a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let's-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited--\"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.\" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear.

Nana is on a road trip, but he is not sure where he is going. All that matters is that he can sit beside his beloved owner Satoru in the front seat of his silver van. Satoru is keen to visit three old friends from his youth, though Nana doesn't know why and Satoru won't say.
